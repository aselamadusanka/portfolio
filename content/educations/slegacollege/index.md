- I have successfully completed the English diploma offered by the Sri Lanka English Language Graduatesâ€™ Association this year, further enhancing my language skills and proficiency.
- The course consists of three phases: Basic, Spoken, and Advanced. It covers all the fundamental subjects starting from scratch.
- After the final examination, an opportunity was provided to obtain a highly valuable certificate recognized both locally and internationally.
